# New-Line-Trim
Program nlTrim.exe
This Windows program removes blank lines from text. I wrote this specifically to use on the reddit r/arduino forum where folks often post their code improperly formatted so there is a blank line or two between each line of code, very annoying. This is a quick and dirty program created under Microsoft Visiual Studio 6 Visual Basic, dating from 2000, running on my antique WinXP laptop.
The concept is that you copy code to the Windows clipboard, paste it into the nlTrim window where it removes blank lines and puts the results back into the clipboard so you can paste it into the compiler IDE.
To use this program first copy text to the clipboard, then click the “Paste” button. This will paste the text into the window, remove the blank lines, and copy the results back into the clipboard. Be patient and wait until Status becomes “Done”. The “Copy” button will also copy the results into the clipboard. Limited to about 65k characters.
